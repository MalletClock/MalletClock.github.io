								<h2>About the project</h2>
							</header>

							<p>WinMind is startup founded in 2022 and I was part of the team that worked on an application for Android and WebGL platforms. Their goal was to enhance the "conversation starter" process and help with the assessment of the overall situation and needs of youth placed in the social and heathcare sectors. <br/><br/>
                            My role in this project focused more on the backend side, but I also took part in making the actual application as well. Part of my duties was managing the company database and creating an employee portal for easy and manageable data observation. The project is currently on hold waiting for a better timing on the markets and more available personnel and resources, since it was produced through practical training as part of a curriculum.
                            </p>

                    <li>Employee portal and API used in project (app and portal) made with ASP.NET Core and Blazor.</li>
                    <li>SQL database hosted through Azure cloud services and managed through Azures portal and Microsoft SQL Server</li>
                    <li>Close collaboration with the WinMind team who work in the social and heathcare sectors.</li>
                    <li>First and foremost app was created to collect answers to specific questions such as WEMWBS and AUDIT</li>
                    <li>Minigames were incorporated into the answering sequence to make it less tedious and giving opportunities for rewarding answering and allowing break time.</li>
                    <li>Later in the project my focus shifted to optimization and ensuring that the user experience would not be hindered on different devices.</li>

                        <h1 style = "font-weight: bold" class="grid-header">WinMind App</h1>
                        <p>I was responsible for creating data management functionalities for the application along with the interface to use them. This included user management, question/answer management and minigame data management.
                            Later I took on the responsibility of keeping the UI layout and the minigames responsive and correct size with different resolutions.<br/><br/>
                            During the project I was given opportunities to create 3D models, animating, rigging and texturing them. As my final work on the project until further notice, I started optimizing the project and wrote my <a style="color:blue;" href="https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2025052214577" target="_blank">thesis</a> on the subject.</p>

                        <h1 style = "font-weight: bold" class="grid-header">Employee Portal</h1>
                        <p>I created the employee portal utilizing Razor components and implemented tables and views in the database for data viewing. Main features in the portal were creating new users for a logged in employee, observing the users answers and controlling the users current status in the application.</p>
